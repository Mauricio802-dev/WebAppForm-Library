# WebAppForm-Library
This is an aplication to libraries, with this app you can create, delete or find the book that you looking to these purposes, well this is a project that I did for my university this is an app simple just I thought will be fine that this app be here

First I have this app divide 2 parts frontend and backend the part of backend is in the branch back and the part frontend is in the part develop

You just have to do is donwload the 2 parts, after you have to create a data base can be sql server or whatever you want, you have in the part backend to connect your data base manually, and after that start the server of part develop and 
cath localhost:**** and put that in the backend for allow that conection and don't have problem of cors

you have to know i did this app long time ago and his base are observables to keep the state updated. good lucky broo.
